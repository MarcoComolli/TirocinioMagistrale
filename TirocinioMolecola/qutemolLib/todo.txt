NOT NEEDED IN 1st VERS?
- variable saturation for colored lights
- faster ao (multiple shadowmaps per pass)
* code cleaning: standarize uniforms/defines/attributes of shaders
- identification of bonds
- loading of bonds
- impostors tubes
- licorice / ball'n'sticks
- ao tubes
- halos
* simplified lighting (when light is from 0,0,1)

BUGS:
* strange can't load molecule bug
* fog with cutplane
- fog with perspective
- shadow-map size not adaptive
- blur range not adaptive with screen size
* near clip plane too close
* DoF sliders disabled on settings?
- problems when direct light completely OFF and light simple
- snapshot dialog: no keyboard input!
- cut plane rotates wrong on 1f2n.pdb
